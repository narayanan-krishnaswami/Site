<p>This is mostly, as the title says, a list of links to stuff that I have enjoyed on the web. There was a time when I, like so many others, believed that what was on the net would be there forever, but then, we were all so naive. Anyway, these links are part of my internet history.</p>
<h2>Fantasy</h2>
<ol><li> <a href="https://greyhawkonline.com/gordmain/">Gord's Greyhawk</a>: I first came across this website in the 90s, I think. I had been playing Adom a lot, and searching for the Cat Lord, I came across this <a href+"https://greyhawkonline.com/gordmain/inner/#catlord">page</a>. It was a lot plainer then, just black text on a white background, but I was soon lost in the world of Oerth. Later, I found what a labor of love it was for <a href="https://greyhawkonline.com/author-bio-krista-siren/">Krista Siren</a>. </li>
  <li><a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/jordan/Humor/alt.shrugged.html">alt.shrugged</a>: I came to Robert Jordan late, but then when I did, I <i>consumed</i> the Wheel of Time series. The WoT fandom in the late 1990s was waspish, brilliant and insightful - and also very funny. Maybe the old discussions at rasfwrj - (rec.arts.sf.written.robert.jordan)  usenet group are still knocking around on Google groups somewhere, but it would be the equivalent of a visit to an abandoned city. alt.shrugged is a very funny mashup of Atlas Shrugged with newsgroup regulars playing the roles of Dagny Taggart and others, a remnant from another era of the internet. Unsurprisingly, the author of this piece is a <a href=https://www.amazon.com/stores/Joel-Hafvenstein/author/B001JP2738?ref=ap_rdr&store_ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true""> published author</a> in his own right.</li>
  <li><a href-"https://www.tor.com/author/leigh-butler/">Leigh Butler's</a> rereads. Leigh Butler is a frequent contributor to Tor.com, and I really enjoyed her read through blogs for both <a href="https://www.tor.com/features/series/wot-reread/"<>Wheel of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.tor.com/features/series/a-read-of-ice-and-fire/">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>. She's funny, insightful and whileI may not agree with her takes on a few things, I enjoy her writing. Jenn Lyons' A Ruin of Kings is on my reading list simply because there's a Leigh Butler reread for it.</a> 
  </ol>
<h2>Video Channels</h2>
<ol><li>Dave Plummer's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNzszbnvQeFzObW0ghk0Ckw">video channel</a>. One of the first programming books I got into was Jim Conger's Windows API Bible.  Dave Plummer is an old Windows hand, and the guy who wrote the Task Manager. An excellent, eclectic channel and programming resource.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Computing</h3>
	   <ol>
	     <li>This profile of <a href="https://archive.ph/EGhl4">Hank Asher</a>, the man behind our data age, and probably the father of data analytics, is a superb profile, one of those things that the <a href="nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> does so well. Such a pity it also has Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman and all those others as well.</li>
	     <li><a href="https://www.linfo.org/thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a> is up there, along with Dennis Ritchie and Ada Lovelace - a legend of computing, kernel designer, game developer, language creator and so much else. This is his legendary lecture on computer security - <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">Reflections on Trusting Trust (pdf)</a>, given when he received his Turing award.</a>
