<h1>Welcome to Narayanan's Home Page</h1>
</center>
    <p>Hi. I'm K Narayanan, an occasional journalist, writer, coder, project manager, marketer, reader, quizzer and gamer.
    </p>
<p>I sometimes write for The Hindustan Times. A list of my pieces for the Hindustan Times can be found here. My last piece for them was on Transmedia Storytelling, and you can find it here </p>
<p>There was also a time when I used to quiz - and I set a weekly quiz in the Sunday Times of India - Bangalore edition - for several years. You can find the quizzes here. </p>
