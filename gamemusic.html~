  <h1>Game Music</h1>
  <p>While I spend a lot of time playing games, I may not be the
  best person to talk of video game music. But what I can do is
  talk about a few gaming experiences I have had where the music
  made a significant difference to my gameplay experience.Also, a
  lot of this is context driven. So sometimes the music may sound
  strange in isolation. Where you are in the game also adds to the
  effect the music has on the gameplay</p>

      <div class="separator" style=

        You're a lone soldier in an overrun military base. The
        teleportation tech that the government has been
        experimenting with has been compromised. You have to make
        your way through dimensional slipgates into strange
        environments full of monsters, and stay alive until you can
        deal with the malign brain behind it all. This is early on
        in the game, a water-filled level called the Necropolis.

          Michael Hoenig<br />
            <div>
              You've just turned 18. All your life, you have lived
              in the cloistered library city of Candlekeep. One
              day, your foster father comes to you in a state of
              panic, telling you that you are in terrible danger,
              and the two of you need to leave Candlekeep and find
              shelter elsewhere. You leave Candlekeep, but on the
              way, you are accosted by a sinister figure in armour,
              and his ogre bodyguards. Your foster father dies
              defending you, but you manage to escape. It is your
              first night in the wilderness. There are wolves. And
              there is a murderer looking for you, and night falls.

        You wake up in a mortuary. You have been killed again. You
        have no memory of who you are, but your body is full of
        cryptic tattooed instructions about what you should do once
        you recover from your latest death. And slowly, you start
        to figure out who you are, and why you cannot die. Along
        the way you pick up a group of companions - each accursed
        in their own way, each one tormented. And one of them is
        Vhailor, a member of the group of Mercykillers, a sect
        dedicated to bringing justice. And when he finds out about
        the magnitude of your crimes, there is a reckoning

    <li>2000. Icewind Dale.&nbsp; Kuldahar. Jeremy Soule<br />
      <div class="separator" style=
      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        Up in the frozen North, in the spine of the world, where
        the air freezes in your lungs, there is a village called
        Kuldahar which nestles in the shelter of an ancient
        lifegiving oak tree. The tree is vast, and radiates a field
        of warmth. The village and the tree share a symbiotic
        relationship, making the place a welcome one for the weary
        and cold traveller. This was the first time I'd heard of
        Jeremy Soule, one of videogame music's most prolific
        composers.<br />

      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        In the Star Wars galaxy, the planet Manaan, for millenia,
        was the only source of kolto, a rare and valuable medicinal
        substance. Manaan was home to the aquatic species Selkath,
        who remained neutral in conflicts between the Jedi and the
        Sith. Kolto itself was believed to be produced by an
        ancient Giant Firaxian Shark called the progenitor - who
        holds one piece of a larger puzzle you need to solve to
        find what the Sith Lord Darth Malak plans to do in his war
        against the old Republic.

        6. 2006. The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Jeremy Soule.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div class="separator" style=
      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        This one is very personal. I bought my first console - an
        XBox 360 - in Mustapha's in Singapore. I bought 3 games
        with it. One of them was Oblivion. When I got home and
        plugged it in, this was the first game I played. While it
        may look dated today, it was mindblowing then, especially
        when you finish the prologue and escape from prison and
        step out into a wide new world. Oh, and the opening
        narration was by Patrick Stewart, and it had Sean Bean as
        your companion. He dies, of course.

        &nbsp;(I played this to Hari once. He was quite bewildered,
        and tried hard to be polite)

        7. 2007. Mass Effect. Vigil. Jack Wall
      </div>
      <div class="separator" style=
      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        Another personal favourite. I've been Commander Shepard,
        oh, for thousands of hours, across three games. Mass Effect
        is a space opera, and you are pitted against
        extra-terrestrial eldritch abominations intent on
        destroying sentient life. But the greatest part of the game
        is not the combat. It's about the people - both human and
        alien - that you meet, and how you choose to save the
        galazy. And this piece - the opening music - so full of
        longing - absolutely captures a moment in the game where
        you meet a remnant of a long dead species.

      </div>
      <div class="separator" style=
      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        It's not original music that makes a game all the time.
        Bioshock 2 was nowehere as good as its predecessor., which
        had one of the greatest gut-punches in gaming. But this
        piece has stayed in my memory, and for good reason. It's
        played during a loading screen, and on a gramaphone,
        in-game.<br />

        9. 2010. Mass Effect 2. Suicide Mission. Jack Wall.
      </div>
      <div class="separator" style=
      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        Mass Effect 2 is quite simply, one of the best games ever
        made. Think of it as a dirty dozen in space - where you
        have to be friend, philosopher and guide to a ragtag bunch
        of misfits - and travel into deep space to blow up a space
        station - a suicide mission if there ever was one. ANd if
        you have done the right things - talked to you teammates,
        understood what they were good at, helped them with their
        problems, researched alien tech, upgraded your ship, no one
        will die in the final mission. And your reward is the look
        of respect you get from your teammates as you walk through
        the ship afterwards.&nbsp;

      </div>
      <div class="separator" style=
      "clear: both; text-align: left;">
        It's probably the most famous boss fight in gaming. You
        enter this massive, pillared hall. At the other end is a
        balcony, and on it is an armoured figure - Dragon-slayer
        Ornstein. He looks at you, and raises his spear. Lightning
        crackles along it. He jumps down. And behind him, another
        figure rises, a huge man who dwarfs the 8 foot tall
        Ornstein. Smough carries a ridiculously large hammer, but
        on him, it's the right size You hold your breath, and
        before you let it go, Ornstein has charged across the room
        and you are wriggling at the end of his spear.

        One of the most popular comments on the video is "So this
        is how it sounds like after 10 seconds...". Because that's
        how long you last in this legendarily difficult battle.
