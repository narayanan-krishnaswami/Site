  <h1>Murder</h1>
    <p>
        A murdered celebrity. An obsessed investigator. A blind
        psychic. Mysterious and maddening clues. A lone witness. A
        shocking twist, and even more shocking revelations. Tragedy, as the investigator discovers the
        murderer he is chasing is ... himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        This may sound like any of the darker and edgier 'psychological'
        thrillers that have been churned out in the later part of
        the last century, or even one of Agatha Christie's later  murder
        mysteries -   Endless Night, maybe? But it's also an outline of a
        play performed in 429 BC, Sophocles'  Oedipus Rex.
    </p>
    <p>
        Murder, as Raymond Chandler once said, has been going on too
        long for it to be news.  And yet,it is.
    </p>
    <h3>Tales of Blood</h3>
    <p>
        From Cain killing Abel in the Bible, Set's murder of Osiris in ancient
        Egypt or the Gongan crime dramas of 13th century China, tales of
        murder have fascinated us. Shakespeare reveled in it -
        think Macbeth, or Julius Caeser, or the bloodbath that is Titus Andronicus. The
        obsession with the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811 spurred
        Thomas DeQuincey into writing On Murder Considered as one of the
        Fine Arts in 1827. And then the inflection point in 1841, when the
        first modern detective story, Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the
        Rue Morgue made its appearance in the pages of Graham's Lady's
        and Gentleman's Magazine. It was an immediate sensation - and
        widely translated. One of it's translators was a young Frenchman
        named Charles Baudelaire, and his translations inspired Emile
        Gaboriau to write L'Affaire Lerouge, which introduced Inspector
        Lecoq - the first police detective.Across the Atlantic, Seeley
        Regester, queen of the dime novel, published The Dead Letter in 1867,
        probably the first murder mystery written by a woman. The next
        year, on the other side of the world, Mary Fortune began her long
        running series The Detective's Album  featuring detective Mark
        Sinclair in the Australian Journal. The Detectives Album would run
        from 1868 to 1908 - until Fortune's failing eyesight made her
        unable to write anymore. In the US, Regester was
        followed by Anna Katharine Green, whose The Leavenworth Case , was
        published in 1878 to wide critical acclaim and popular
        success.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even more significant was an event that took place in the mid
        1840s, when a cooper named Alan Pinkerton chanced upon a group
        of counterfeiters in the woods near his Illiois home. After
        observing their activities, he reported them to the local
        sherriff. By 1949, he was Chicago's first police detective. The
        next year, he, along with Donald Rucker, a lawyer, had founded
        the Pinkerton National Detective Agency - an organization whose
        operatives appear in books by authors ranging from Arthur Conan
        Doyle to Alistair Maclean, from Gore Vidal to Ian
        Fleming.Pinkerton was a hugely popular author himself and wrote
        a series of books, ostensibly based on his own exploits - from
        foiling a plot on Abraham Lincoln's life to union-busting (a
        tradition that continues to the present day - Amazon hired the
        Pinkertons (now part of security conglomerate Securitas and
        named Securitas Security Services USA to spy on their employees
        for signs of union activity )
    </p>
    <h3>True Detective</h3>
    <p>
        By the time Arthur Conan Doyle
        wrote A Study in Scarlet, the murder mystery was a long
        established genre. Both Lecoq and Dupin were familiar -
        and well-established figures, but they were also the old gods, to be taken
        down  by their successor  - Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Between Holmes first appearance in A Study in Scarlet in 1887
        and His Last Bow in 1917,  there were a whole slew of detectives
        and criminals (and sometimes both in the same character)
        who made their appearance. Israel Zangwill, a Lithuanian
        immigrant to London (and the person who popularized the term
        'melting pot' in the cultural context with his play of the same
        name) wrote The Big Bow Mystery, one of the earliest 'locked-room
        mysteries' , in 1892. Sexton Blake - a conscious imitation of
        Holmes (complete with lodgings on Baker Street), kicked off a
        career that has lasted into the 21st century.   Arthur Morrisson's chubby and
        cheerful Martin Hewitt made his appearance in 1894. Edgar
        Wallace's The Four Just Men
        Maurice Leblanc created Arsene Lupin in 1905, Richard Austin
        Freeman created Dr Thorndyke, the forensic detective  in
        1907, 1907 also saw Gaston Leroux, famous as the author of The
        Phantom of the Opera, write The Mystery of the Yellow Room.  The
        next year, Mary Roberts Rinehart wrote her first murder mystery,
        The Circular Staircase. GK Chesterton's Father Brown debuted in
        1910, when  The Blue Cross (originally titled Valentin Follows a
        Curious Trail) appeared in the Saturday Evening Post. By 1913,
        the genre was so well established that it gained its own great
        satire - EC Bentley's Trent's Last Case, an affectionate
        but satirical take on the detective story.There was also Ellis
        Parker Butler's parodies featuring Philo Gubb,  who learnt detection through a correspondence course, wears
        terrible disguises, and murders the English language whenever he speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
        You would have thought the appearance of parodies would mark
        the end of a genre - but the Great War happened - and after it
        came the Golden Age.
    </p>
    <h3>The Golden Age</h3>
    <p>
        In 1929, two years after the publication of Arthur Conan Doyle's last Sherlock
        Holmes volume, Agatha Christie released Partners in Crime, a
        collection of linked short stories featuring Tommy and Tuppence
        Beresford. Each short adventure has Tommy and Tuppence taking on
        the personas of famous fictional detectives of that time - some
        immortal - like Holmes and Poirot, others
        still remembered by aficionados - like Thorndyke and Ernest
        Bramah's blind detective Max Carrados, and others all but
        forgotten - Valentine Williams' Okewood brothers, Isabel
        Ostrander's McCarty and Riordan, Clinton Stagg's Thornley Cotton
        (another blind detective - you probably couldnb't throw a white
        cane without hitting a blind detective in the 20s, it seems),
        Baroness Orczy's Old Man in a Corner, AEW Mason's Inspector
        Hanaud, Freeman Wills Croft's Inspector French, specialist in
        locked-room mysteries, Anthony Berkeley's Roger Sherringham, and HC
        Bailey's Dr Reggie Fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes created the popular murder
        mystery tropes, Christie codfied, subverted, averted and inverted
        them. And she wasn't the only queen of crime. The Golden Age of
        Detective fiction - the interbellum years of 1920 to 1940 - saw
        the emergence of other great female crime writers: Margery
        Allingham with her detective Albert Campion; Dorothy  L Sayers
        with Lord Peter Wimsey (think Bertie Wooster with brains- Sayers
        worked for the advertising agency SH Benson,
        also wrote the tagline for Guinness - "Guinness is Good for You",
        a line used by the brewer to this day) ; and New Zealander Ngaio
        Marsh, with  Inspector Roderick Alleyn. There were other murder
        mystery writers as well, this was arguably the time when male
        writers nranched off into the 'thriller' space, and the women
        dominated the classical murder mystery.
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in America, a revolution had been brewing.</p>
    <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
    <p>
        In 1915, at the age of 21, Samuel Dashiell Hammett joined the
        Pinkertons as a detective. He worked there for siz years, with
        time out to serve in World War I.  Wracked by tubercolosis, Hammett
        quit the Pinkertons and turned his hand to writing. His first
        story, The Parthian Shot came out in the magazine The Smart Set in
        October 1922. The Smart Set was a magazine run by the journalist
        HL Mencken and the drama critic George Jean Nathan. Mencken and
        Nathan also had another magazine that they started in 1920. Called
        Black Mask, it specialized in gritty stories of violence. In 1923,
        it published a story called Three Gun Terry by Carroll John Daly,
        arguably the first 'hard-boiled' detective. Soon, Hammett, with
        his own real-life experience, was writing his own detective
        stories for the Black Mask, featuring a short, overweight detective working for the
        Continental Detective Agency.</p>
