    National Highway 275 is a long ribbon of road running from Mysore to Mangalore. You wind your way through Hunsur and Periyapatna, through corn and tobacco fields. As you approach the bridge over the Cauvery, the point where Mysore district gives way to Madikere, you begin to see pennant streamers. The flags on the streamers repeat the same colours, in the same sequence: blue, white, red, green and yellow. The blue flags represent the sky; white: clouds; red: fire; green: leaves and yellow for the earth. Each colour is a sound as well. Blue is om. White is ma. Red is ni. Green is padme. Yellow is hum.
</p>
<p><i>Om mani padme hum.</i></p>

<h3>India is the guru</h3>

<p>Karma Damdul is the officer in charge of the Lugsung Samdupling Tibetan Settlement - the official name of the oldest Tibetan settlement in India. But no one calls it that. For locals and visitors, the place is Bylakuppe. </p><p>

Damdul’s room looks like the office of any senior small town bureaucrat. The desk is cluttered, but tidy. There is a sofa set, arranged around a small coffee table, and the furniture emphasizes economy and function over comfort. There’s a wooden board in one corner, with the names of previous settlement officers and their periods of tenure painted on it in white lettering.
 </p><p>
The portraits on the walls are different, though. There’s a picture of the Mahatma, of course. There’s also a picture of the Dalai Lama. And, in pride of place, complete with sandalwood garland, is a large framed photograph of Siddavanahalli Nijalingappa.
 </p><p>
“When the Chinese government cracked down on Tibet, there were many Tibetans who fled to India, and Prime Minister Nehru asked the Chief Ministers if they could help accommodate the refugees in their home states, and Nijalingappa was the first to offer us a home. There were around 3,000 refugees who needed homes, and he offered us 3,000 acres in Karnataka,” he says.
 </p><p>
Nijalingappa is revered among India’s Tibetans. As recently as 2011[NK1] , the Dalai Lama paid tribute to the late politician, calling him “an honest politician wedded to principle”.
 </p><p>
In Bylekuppe, the Dalai Lama is everywhere. His face beams down from pictures in every house. “His Holiness says”, “His Holiness believes” are phrases used to emphasize a point or forestall an argument in conversation. “His Holiness says that all knowledge flows from India,” says Damdul. “He says India is the guru, and Tibet is the chela. And who else can the student turn to at times of trouble but the guru?”
 </p><h3>
Re-establishing a tradition
</h3>
<p>In the 14th century, Lama Tsong Khapa established the Gelug Order. It’s the most significant[NK2]   school of Tibetan Buddhism, and the Dalai Lama is its spiritual leader. Before he died, Tsong Khapa dreamed of a great centre of Buddhist learning. One of his pupils, Jamchen Choje Shakya Yeshe, with funding from the Nedong king, Dagpa Gyaltsen, founded the Sera Monastery in 1419 to fulfill his master’s dream. </p><p>

In 1959, Chinese forces destroyed the monastery and killed hundreds of monks studying there.
 </p><p>
In 1970, 197 monks from the Sera Je college, along with 103 monks from the Sera Me college made their way to Byakuppe. They were allocated 225 acres of land within the settlement and the Indian government sponsored around 40 one-room, tiled houses to accommodate them.  
 </p><p>
The monks cleared the forests and cultivated the fields. They subsisted on what they grew. And piece by piece, they built what are now the Sera Je and Sera Me monasteries.
 </p><p>
Today, the Sera Je monastery is a place of peace in the heart of the settlement. You can hear birdsong and the soft music of wind chimes as you make your way to the imposing assembly hall. The hall itself is dimly lit, with row upon row of maroon and yellow striped mattresses facing a stage dominated by a statue of the Buddha in all his fabled serenity.
</p>
<h3>27 years to monkhood</h3>
<p>
Thupen Chodak is the only person in the hall. Chodak is a geshe, a fully qualified monk. Chodak was born in India, a couple of years after his parents fled Tibet. Both his parents passed away before he was ten, and by the age of fifteen, he found himself in Bylekuppe, studying to be a monk.
 </p><p>
Becoming a monk here is serious business. The path to becoming a geshe makes a Ph D look like half an hour at a playschool. “You study the prajna paramitas for seven to eight years. You spend four years on the madhyamaka. Three years for the vinayas. Then you spend a couple of years on the Abhidharma kosa. Then you study epistemology – pramanavarthika. After all that, you spend six years on examinations. And then, you complete your education by either writing a book. You can also prove yourself by debating the leaders in the field,” says Chodak.
 </p><p>
Despite – or possibly because of - the demanding nature of the curriculum, Chodak says a number of non-Buddhists come to the monastery, wanting to convert. “His Holiness says that people should stick to their own religion – it is part of them, and there is wisdom in all religion. They are welcome to learn Buddhism, of course. But they can take what they learn and apply it to the way they live their lives.”
 </p><p>
Chodak smiles easily, but as he looks around the campus, with its magnificent buildings, the smile fades. “When I was a student, we lived in sheds. There were seven or eight people in a room. I remember our teacher would come with a big loaf of bread which he would break into two halves. One for himself, and the other to be shared by the students. But it didn’t matter that much. It seems that when you have little, your brain works a lot better. When you have plenty…” he trails off.
 </p><p>
All Chodak knows about Tibet is from other people. “If Tibet gets independence, I really wouldn’t know if I’ll feel at home. I’ve lived outside all my life. It would be … strange,” he says.
 </p><h3>
A tale of two cities
</h3><p>
 Where Bylakuppe is green and graceful, Kushalnagar, just across the Cauvery is your typical highway town. It may be part of Madikere, but it’s crowded, noisy and polluted. Kushalnagar has grown because of the tourist traffic that Bylakuppe brings in. Shops have signs in English, Kannada and Tibetan. The Dalai Lama shares a signboard with Sai Baba. Restaurant menus list momos next to Kerala mutton fry and Mulayam Murgh kababs.
 </p><p>
But there’s an undercurrent of unease, of resentment here. “They come here and marry our women,” says one local. “We need the land,” says another. A cashier at a local restaurant is more balanced. “We like the business they bring to the city. But if a Tibetan tries to set up a business here, outside the settlement, he’d be stopped,” he says.
 </p><p>
Maddu Madeva is the sub-inspector at Bylakuppe police station. He has nothing but praise for the people in the encampment. “The Tibetan community is very law abiding. A very peaceful people. Most of our problems are with the locals, not with them.”
 </p><p>
There’s an idol of the Buddha on Madeva’s wall shelf, and it’s the first thing that you see as you enter his office. Madeva point to it and says “I put it there for the Tibetans. They’re so polite, folding their hands as they enter the office. Sometimes, it gets embarrassing. That’s why I put the idol there. It may make them feel more comfortable, and I like to think that when they fold their hands, they’re saluting the Buddha, and not me.”
 </p><p>
 Madeva says that apart from official reasons – police verifications on passes and the like, Tibetans only come to the police station when one of them is involved in a traffic accident. “Once in a while, these things happen. Not very often, though,” he says.
</p>
<h3>Working on a dream</h3>
<p>
Acharya Rinchen Tsering is the headmaster of Sera Jey Secondary School. He is dressed in the traditional robes of Maroon and orange, but he looks fit and tough, the kind of monk who would give footpads lessons in humility with a few powerful blows of a quarterstaff. His school has more than 600 students, and most of them will go on to enter the monastery, and try to become monks.
 </p><p>
“There will always be some who don’t make it,” he says. Tsering was born at Mundgod, and was once a student here. The focus of education at the school is philosophy, with students learning dialectics as early as class 6. “In fact the percentage of Tibetans studying here is declining slightly, because we are seeing students from all over the Buddhist world – Sikkim, Bihar, Arunachal, Himachal, Nepal, Bhutan, even as far away as Mongolia - come here to study.”
 </p><p>
“One day, I hope to see the original Sera,” he says. “We must have hope. And there is reason to hope. His Holiness has been highlighting the cause of the Tibetans all his life, and there is much greater awareness about the suffering of our people,” he says. “My dream is to go there. Whether or not it’s independent, I want to go to Lhasa sometime in my life.”
 </p><p>
“There are two things that His Holiness says are most important,” says Damdul. “One, is that the Tibetan people should stay together. The other is that we should preserve our culture.”
 </p><p>
But parts of the culture are gone for ever. How many people remember how to put up a ba, the huge yakskin tents that could house people and cattle? How many people remember how to harvest salt from the mountain rocks? How many people remember what it was like to race horses on the roof of the world? How many people remember the songs that were sung while milking the dri (female yaks). The generation of Tibetans who remember what life was before the Chinese have mostly died out. The only thing that the refugees scattered around the world can do is to preserve what they can, things like thanka painting and carpet weaving and hawk the results to tourists.
 </p><p>
At Dr Rigzen’s Tibetan medicine clinic, a small crowd of patients wait. Rigzen is attending to a patient, a local woman. She’s here because of joint pains. “Most of my patients are Tibetans, but I’ve been seeing an increase in the number of Indian patients as well,” he says. To practice Tibetan medicine officially requires five years of study, followed by two years of training.
 </p><p>
“It’s completely herbal,” says Rigzen. “The problem, of course, is that herbs that are native to Tibet don’t grow here. So, they’re cultivated in Dharamsala and sent to doctors around the world.”  
</p>
 

<h3>Living as tourist attractions</h3>

<p>In the evening, the Namdroling monastery is crowded with tourists. These are mostly people from the smaller towns in the area. A crowd of women gather near the gate wonder whether the devasthanam is open. There are people posing for photographs every few yards in front of the monastery’s main building. A small crowd gathers around an open window, peering through the darkness to see what’s inside a room that’s obviously closed to the public.
 </p><p>
Rigzen is around nine years old. He’s in class four, and he has a Tibetan history textbook in his hand. He wishes he was elsewhere, but he’s been surrounded by a group of tourists. He’s dressed in maroon robes, and some of the tourists want to have their pictures taken with him. One pinches his cheek and the boy winces and twists away. “I’m sorry, I am too busy,” he says as he finally makes his escape.
 </p><p>
There is a prayer hall at the basement of the monastery, and there is a sign requesting “non-practitioners” to keep out. The sign doesn’t work well. Tourists saunter in, gawking at a monk engaged in prayer, until another monk politely, but firmly, escorts them out.
 </p>
<h3>We will return</h3>
<p>
Tenzing Dolma is the head of the Bylakuppe Women’s Association. “We’re an NGO. It’s the only women’s association in exile,” she says, proudly. The single mother speaks fluent Kannada. Her son studies psychology in Mysore’s St Philomena’s college. Her daughter is a nursing educator, now in Germany.
 </p><p>
Dolma is sure about one thing. “We will return to Tibet,” she says. “I know we will go back. We were nomads once, and we will go back to that way of life. We can make things the way they were.”
 </p><p>
Dolma’s tone becomes increasingly emphatic, as if she is trying to convince herself, more than anyone else.
 </p><p>
But that’s the thing. Even if they return, things have changed, and cannot be put back. The current generation of Tibetans has integrated more and more with the outside world, even as they try to hold on to what they consider the essence of being Tibetan. And they have made some corners of the world their own, little green enclaves with an emphasis on peace and quiet and harmony.
 </p><p>
As dusk falls, cars and buses leave the settlement. The monasteries close. The monks return to their dormitories and prayer halls. The prayer flags flutter in the breeze – hopefully.
