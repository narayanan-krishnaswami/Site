	 <h1>Tolkien Trivia</h1>
<ol>

<li> Tom Bombadil was based on a favourite toy of Tolkien's son Michael, a Dutch doll with a hat with a feather in it. Michael's brother John hated the doll, and stuffed it down the toilet, from where it had to be rescued.  In some ways, representative of the fandom, which is divided into those who adore Tom Bombadil, and those who hate </li><li> Most people know Sauron was defeated by the combined forces of Elves and Men in the War of the Last Alliance, and Elendil, the legendary leader of the Numenorean men, and Gil Galad, the High King of Noldor fought Sauron - who was not at his full power - despite having the One Ring - defeating him at the cost of their own lives, and Elendil's son Isildur cut the ring from Sauron's hand. But Sauron, a Sauron at the peak of his powers had been defeated before, in the First Age.<br/>
   By a dog.<br/>
   Huan, the hound of Valinor, faced Sauron at his stronghold in the Isle of the Werewolves. Sauron took the form of a great werewolf to fight Huan, but the hound gave him a beatdown for the ages.<br/>
   "There befell the battle of Huan and Wolf-Sauron, and howls and baying echoed in the hills, and the watchers on the walls of Ered Wethrin across the valley heard it afar and were dismayed. But no wizardry nor spell, neither fang nor venom, nor devil's art nor beast-strength, could overthrow Huan of Valinor; and he took his foe by the throat and pinned him down. Then Sauron shifted shape, from wolf to serpent, and from monster to his own accustomed form; but he could not elude the grip of Huan without forsaking his body utterly. Ere his foul spirit left its dark house, Lúthien came to him, and said that he should be stripped of his raiment of flesh, and his ghost be sent quaking back to Morgoth; and she said: ‘There everlastingly thy naked self shall endure the torment of his scorn, pierced by his eyes, unless thou yield to me the mastery of thy tower."<br/>
 </li>  
  <li>The Tolkien estate sued TSR (the publishers of Dungeons and Dragons) 
</li><li>
In 1972,  Peter Jordan, Fred Thiessen, and Eric White became the first to summit three unnamed peaks in the Cadwallader mountain range in Canada.  One night, the party was caught in a snowstorm, and passed the time reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.  These mountains were then officially named after Tolkien's characters - Mt Gandalf, Mt Shadowfax, and Mt Aragorn. There are also mountains named Caradhras, Orthanc and  Mindolluin Crag in Washington State, USA
</li><li> Treebeard the Ent was based in part on Tolkien's friend and rival, CS Lewis. 
</li><li>Tolkien began work on a sequel to LoTR called The New Shadow, but abandoned it after 13 pages. He had this to say.
	"I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the Downfall, but it proved both sinister and depressing. Since we are dealing with Men it is inevitable that we should be concerned with the most regrettable feature of their nature: their quick satiety with good. So that the people of Gondor in times of peace, justice and prosperity, would become discontented and restless — while the dynasts descended from Aragorn would become just kings and governors — like Denethor or worse. I found that even so early there was an outcrop of revolutionary plots, about a centre of secret Satanistic religion; while Gondorian boys were playing at being Orcs and going around doing damage. I could have written a 'thriller' about the plot and its discovery and overthrow — but it would have been just that. Not worth doing."
</li><li>In 1968, the film producer at Apple (the Beatles company, not the Jobs/Cook one) had an idea of doing a Lord of the Rings film. He sent the Fab Four, who were in Rishikesh at the time, copies of the book. The Beatles loved it and approached Tolkien, who immediately turned them down. 
	If he had agreed, it would have starred Paul McCartney as Frodo, Ringo Starr as Sam Gamgee, and  Harrison as Gandalf. And John Lennon as Gollum!  The Beatles' choice of director? Stanley Kubrick!
</li><li>JRR's brother Hilary Tolkien lived a quiet life as a farmer. The brothers remained close all their lives.  In 2009, Hilary's grandson Chris  found an exercise book full of fantasy stories, his wartime experiences, and writings about the English countryside that he loved. These were then published as Black &amp; White Ogre Country: The Lost Tales of Hilary Tolkien.
</li><li>Sam Gamgee was Tolkien's favourite character from LoTR, inasmuch as an author can have a favourite character. In a letter,he wrote "“My ‘Samwise’ is indeed (as you note) largely a reflexion of the English soldier—grafted on the village-boys of early days, the memory of the privates and my batmen that I knew in the 1914 War, and recognized as so far superior to myself.”
</li><li>Tolkien's first cousins Mary and Marjorie Incledon introduced him to his first constructed language while he was still in his early teens - Animalic, which they had invented. Mary and Tolkien also created a language called Nevbosh. 
</li><li>Tolkien met Edith Bratt, another orphan, when he was 16 and she was 19. They would, according to Tolkien biographer Humphrey Carpenter,  "took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ...With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish."
		Tolkien's guardian, Father Francis Morgan, did not approve of this relationship, and forbade him from any contact with Edith until he was 21.  Tolkien obeyed.
		In the meanwhile, Edith felt that she had been "put on the shelf by Tolkien", and became engaged to a friend's brother. 
		On the eve of his 21st birthday she received a letter from Tolkien, declaring his love, and asking her to marry him. That week, Tolkien travelled to Cheltenham to meet her. Edith met him at the station, returned her engagement ring to her fiancee, and announced that she was marrying Tolkien.

</li><li>In 1969, author and fan Vera Chapman started the Tolkien Society. The next year, she met Tolkien at a party and  agreed to become the Society's honorary president.  Tolkien died the following year, and Chapman offered the presidency to his son Christopher. He wrote back suggesting that his father could remain president in perpetuity. JRR continues as the President of the Tolkien Society, half a century after his death.</li><li> The story probably closest to Tolkien’s heart was the tale of Beren and Luthien, where Luthien, an elven princess falls in love with Beren, a mortal man. The idea for the story came to Tolkien in 1918, when Tolkien, then a lieutenant in the army during WWI, was stationed in Kingston Upon Hull, he and his wife Edith went for a walk in the woods. There, Edith danced for him in a clearing full of flowers, and this was the inspiration for the mortal Beren, who sees Luthien (the word meant “daughter of flowers in Tolkien’s Sindarin, the language of the elves) dancing in the forest and falls in love with her.</li><li> When Beren asks Luthien’s father Thingol for her hand, Thingol, who isnt particularly keen on the marriage, sets Beren a seemingly impossible task as a precondition for his consent - he asks Beren for one of the fabled Silmarils - priceless, magical gems of light, set in the crown of Middle Earth’s equivalent of Satan, Morgoth (For those who don’t know, Morgoth was Sauron’s boss, so make of that what you will).Beren gets captured, and it is Luthien who rescues him. Together, they manage to steal a Silmaril from Morgoth’s crown. </li><li>Luthien gives up her Elven immortality to be with Beren. Tolkien was deeply affected by his wife’s becoming a member of the Catholic Church to marry him, against a lot of resistance from her friends and family.</li><li> Tolkien and his wife Edith are buried side-by-side in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. The tombstone reads 
<pre>
    “Edith Mary Tolkien 
    Luthien
    1889-1971
    John Ronald Reuel Tolkien
    Beren
    1892-1973
</pre></li><li>Almost every  source code file  for the Perl programming language begins with a quote from Tolkien. A sample, from the file mathoms.c
    <pre>
		./mathoms.c- *  Anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to
		./mathoms.c- *  throw away, they called a mathom.  Their dwellings were apt to become
		./mathoms.c- *  rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that passed from
		./mathoms.c- *  hand to hand were of that sort.
		./mathoms.c- *
		./mathoms.c: *     [p.5 of _The Lord of the Rings_: "Prologue"]
</pre>
</li><li> In 1938 the Nazis would only create a German version of The Hobbit if Tolkien proved his Aryan heritage. Tolkien wrote back that he disavows any sort of "race doctrine". He responded to a question from a German publisher who wanted to know if he was "Aryan" with "I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people."

</li><li>In 1961, CS Lewis nominated Tolkien for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Nobel jury rejected Tokien, writing "the result has not in any way measured up to storytelling of the highest quality".

</li><li>Tolkien loathed Disney. He once wrote to a fan saying "I recognize (Walt Disney's) talent, but it has always seemed to me hopelessly corrupted. Though in most of the 'pictures' proceeding from his studios there are admirable or charming passages, the effect of all of them to me is disgusting. Some have given me nausea "
		He also forbade Disney from being involved in any adaptation of his books, saying he forbade Disney from ever becoming involved ''as long as it was possible to veto anything from or influenced by the Disney studios for all whose works I have a heartfelt loathing''

</li><li>Tolkien spoke Esperanto, the constructed language created fior universal communication created by  Warsaw-based ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887.
</li><li>Of all the cast of Peter Jackson's Tolkien films, only Sir Christopher Lee had met Tolkien. Lee was a huge Tolkien fan who read The Lord of the Rings every year.
</li><li>Other fans of Tolkien include King Charles and Prince William, Pope Francis who once preached a sermon in 2008 where he used the stories of Bilbo and Frodo to describe "journeys of hope" and the battle between good and evil.
</li><li>Árpád Göncz, former President of Hungary, who in the 1980s translated The Lord of the Rings and Farmer Giles of Ham to Hungarian, 
</li><li>Well before George RR Martin, Tolkien worked on a story involving incestuous siblings. Turin Turambar, a legendary hero from the First Age, fell in love with a strange woman he called Niniel, and married her. The evil dragon Glaurung, mortally wounded by Turin, revealed to Niniel that she was Turin's sister, before dying. The horrified Niniel killed herself. Not exactly the kind of relationship Jaime and Cersei enjoyed, though.
</li><li>Tolkien initially created a character called Tevildo, the mightiest of cats, also known as Tiberth (from the cat Tibert in the medieval tales of Reynard the fox). Tolkien then reworked the character into Sauron, the foremost of the evil Valar (godlike beings) Melkor's servants.
</li><li>The creation story of Tolkien's world is the Ainulindalë, or the great song. Music creates the world, as well as the creatures in it. It's a theme that was used by his friend and fellow Inkling. CS Lewis as well. In Lewis' The Magician's Nephew, its protagonists Diggory Kirke and Polly Plummer see a world being sung into existence by Aslan, the magical lion.
</li><li>The Tolkien Ensemble  is a Danish group which created "the world's first complete musical interpretation of the poems and songs from The Lord of the Rings". They published four CDs from 1997 to 2005, in which all the poems and songs of The Lord of the Rings are set to music. The project was approved by the Tolkien Estate. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave permission to use her illustrations on the CD covers.
</li><li>Tolkien plundered Norse mythology for names - Bifur,  Bombur, Dain, Durin, Dvalin, Fili, Fundin, Gandalf, Gloin, Kili, Ori, Oin, Thorin, are all named in the poetic Edda, believed to have been written at the end of the first millennium.
</li><li>When publisher Stanley Unwin received the manuscript for The Hobbit, he passed it on to his 10-year-old son, Rayner. He paid Rayener a shilling for each book he read and reviewed, believing that children were the best judges of children's literature. Rayner loved the story, and wrote this review:
			<blockquote>
			  "Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit who lived in his Hobbit hole and never went for adventures, at last Gandalf the wizard and his Dwarves persuaded him to go. He had a very ex[c]iting time fighting goblins and wargs. At last they got to the lonely mountain; Smaug, the dragon who guards it is killed and after a terrific battle with the goblins he returned home – rich!<br/>
			  
			This book, with the help of maps, does not need any illustrations it is good and should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9."
			</blockquote>
			
			Needless to say, Unwin published The Hobbit.</li><li>
From Led Zeppelin and Rush to Joni Mitchell and Enya, Rock and Metal musicians have paid homage to Tolkien and his work. Even Rahman has been on the Tolkien bandwagon, composing the music for The Lord of the Rings Musical, along with Värttinä and Christopher Nightingale.
</li><li> Tolkien bought his first car in 1932, and let's just say that he wasn't very lucky as a driver. He converted his misadventures with his car into a children's story called Mr Bliss, one of the rare stories not set in a medieval or fantasy setting. Tolkien's last published work was the novella Smith of Wootton Major. It was originally titled The Great Cake, but Tolkien changed its name to Smith of Wootton Major in a nod to PG Wodehouse.</li><li> Tolkien's The Silmarillion was his life's work, but was published only posthumously, after his son Christopher painstakingly put the book together from his fathers notes and writings. The fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay worked as Christopher's assistant in editing The Silmarillion.</li><li>Bilbo and Frodo Baggins lived at Bag End. "Bag End" was the real name of the Tudor home, dated to 1413, of Tolkien's aunt Jane Neave in the village of Dormston, Worcestershire</li><li>In early versions of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo's name was Bingo Bolger-Baggins. Shades of the Stan Lee alliterative naming convention?</li><li>Ian Holm played Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's LoTR trilogy. Twenty years earlier, he had played Frodo Baggins in the BBC's radio adaptation.
</li><li>Tolkien hated paperbacks. When the American publisher Donald Wolfheim contacted Tolkien in 1964 and asked if he could publish Lord of the Rings as  paperbacks, Tolkien said he would never allow work to appear in so ‘degenerate a form’ as the paperback book.
</li><li>Tolkien's father passed away when he was three, and his mother brought him and his brother Hilary up. She joined the Catholic church in 1900, when JRR was 8, and was disowned by her Baptist family.
</li><li>Tolkien's mother passed away four years later, at the age of 34 - from acute diabetes. Before her death, she entrusted the care of her children to her close friend Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory.
</li><li>While he was a student at Oxford, Tolkien stole a bus and gave his fellow students a joyride.
</li><li>Tolkien initially planned a Hobbit sequel with a giant, not a dragon, as the foe. Early outlines had a "Giant Tree Beard" capturing Gandalf, like Saruman does later. Bilbo's new treasure quest was comical but turned darker, becoming The Lord of the Rings; Bilbo was sidelined in favour of his nephew Frodo.
</li><li>Aragorn was initially supposed to be a hobbit nicknamed, who unlike most hobbits, wore wooden shoes. Trotter was supposed to have helped Gandalf track Gollum down. He had been captured by the Dark Lord and tortured, and had lost his feet as a result.
</li><li>Tolkien drew from the Finnish epic Kalevala, notably Kullervo's tale, shaping Middle-earth. Kullervo's story is echoed in Túrin Turambar's tale. Both are tragic heroes who accidentally commit incest with their sister who on finding out kills herself by leaping into water. Both heroes later kill themselves after asking their sword if it will slay them, which it confirms
</li><li>There were five colour-coded wizards in Tolkien's legendarium - Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey and Radagast the Brown play parts in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. There are two blue wizards as well - Alator and Pallando - who went to Middle Earth to help those fighting Sauron.
</li><li>British historian Dominic Sandbrook points out: "An amateur psychologist could have a field day with the fact that both JRR Tolkien and Agatha Christie lost parents in their childhood and nursed a sense of loss for the rest of their careers. (Perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that the only writers of their generation to rival them in terms of sales – Enid Blyton, who was born in 1897; Barbara Cartland, who was born in 1901; and of course Catherine Cookson, born in 1906 – all had similar memories of loss and upheaval. Cookson hated her mother and never knew her father, Blyton’s father walked out when she was 13, and Cartland’s father was killed in Flanders when she was a teenager.)"
</li><li>Over a span of two decades, J.R.R. Tolkien would send his children illustrated letters from Santa Claus, featuring Santa's encounters with goblins riding bats, fireworks, a mischievous polar bear, and various newly devised languages.
</li><li>When Michael, Tolkien's second son, joined the army, he gave his father's occupation as "Wizard".
</li><li>While Tolkien was a gifted artist, and drew both illustrations and maps for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, it was his son Christopher who did the final maps for The Lord of the Rings.
</li><li>Tolkien published two novels (The Hobbit and LoTR),  two volumes of poetry and seven short works during his life. Everything else - including The Silmarillion - was the result of Christopher Tolkien's painstaking work on his fathers notes.
