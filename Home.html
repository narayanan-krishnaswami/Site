    <h2>Coming Home</h2>
    <p>Home is Nungambakkam. Jambulinga Naikar  Street. I don't think anyone remembers who Jambulinga Naikar was, not anymore. People I've spoken to think it was a Madras High Court Judge, but the street predates him.</p>
    <p>Home is Mithila, the big yellow house at the end of Jambulingam Street. It used to be number 17, then 23, now it is 32.  Construction began in 1946, and was completed in September 1947. My grandfather moved in with his three children and his widowed sister in October 1947. It would have been pleasingly metaphorical if the family had begun occupancy in August, but still...</p>
    <p>I was born in Hyderabad, but this house was all I knew until I was 17.</p>
    <p>We were a joint family. My parents, sister and I stayed on the ground floor. My chitappa, his wife, their son and daughter stayed on the first floor with my grandfather. When I was 11, my uncle and his family moved out to another house in Alwarpet, leaving my family in sole possession of the house in Jambulingam Street</p>
    <p>I've lived elsewhere of course. I returned after 12 years in Bangalore, where home meant different apartments within a single square kilometer of Malleshwaram. I've lived in Hyderabad, where home was Ameerpet. And in Biella, where home was via Bertodano. But I would return home from all these homes, and I would return to Jambulinga Naikar Street.</p>
    <p>The house changed over the years. The street rose and so the compound had to be relaid higher. The rooms in the ground floor were let out to tenants, and then abandoned - staying closed and dark. The stairside window sill where I read so many books was shuttered because my father feared that "cats would get in". Rooms gathered dust, coming alive only when there was a wedding in the family, when droves of relatives would land up and  there would be lights and laughter and the courtyard would be full of children playing. But over time, the children grew up, emigrated and it seemed that the old girl was doomed to become yet another of those houses that are just  waiting for the last stakeholder to die, so that they can be sold off to a developer, who would then build an ugly block of apartments and call them 'Devon' or 'Elegant Apartments'.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, my youngest nephew got married. The wedding was in Chennai. And all the cousins and aunts and uncles landed up, this time from all across the globe. The hall was filled with 80-year-olds gossiping about life in Nellore in the 50s, while their grandchildren planned visits to beauty parlours or booze shops. The kitchen hummed with life. The laughter of children was everywhere.</p>
