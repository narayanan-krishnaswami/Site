    <p>Sorcia took off her boots. The rock was cold, but not unpleasantly so. She closed her eyes and stretched her hands out at her sides. Reaching out, through the rock, through the earth beneath the rock, and below, until she could feel the long, slow heartbeat of the mountains. She could feel the roots of ancient trees - oaks and pines and sreve, she could feel the warmth of distant volcanic activity. The cold rush of underground streams, of vast caverns and the veins of metal - silver, but copper and iron as well. </p>
    <p>The breeze was a caress on her face. Like the rock, it was cold, but refreshing. She could smell the smoke of the campfire, the meat roasting on the makeshift spit that Keorn had put together after Dira had shot one of the huge hares that seemed to be everywhere in these mountains.</p><p>There were other smells - the green smell of oak leaves, the scent of pine needles, the tang of redmoss that seemed to grow in abundance, the bready smell of silverhead mushrooms, even the subtle smell of snow.</p>
    <p>She was a conduit. A junction point. She could feel the world flow through her. It was like being reborn.</p>
    <p>The others let her be. Most of them knew her well enough not to intrude, and her reputation ensured the distance of the rest. She could sense them all, three groups around three fires, talking quietly. She could smell the metal of pans and weapons and rings and talismans, hear the the gentle  shifting of a slumbering  bearlord, birds in their nests far above. And there were other things...</p>
    <p>She stayed like that for almost an hour, before returning to the fire. Dira looked at her interrogatively</p>
    <p>She frowned. "I'm not sure. I counted three powerful beings, but I couldn't say much more. They seemed to be dormant, slumbering. There are two magic users in the town.One strong, the other, very strange - I can't tell what kind. Plenty of regular dangers though - snow tigers, wolfpacks, styrixes. There's a bearlord as well, but it's just begun hibernating." she paused. "There's something about this place - it's ancient, and I think there may be things so old I cannot even recognize them."</p>
    <p>Dira nodded. "The old man said that the principal's representative seemed <i>very</i> dangerous. Maybe she's the magus? Anyway - the expected and the unexpected in the usual proportion. Which is as good as can be expected, I suppose. We'll deal when we have to deal, come on and eat something."</p>
    <p>Sorcia followed the dwarf, smiling. Was it something about the way dwarves saw the world, she wondered. She had never seen Dira flustered, or Keorn, for that matter. Even when facing certain death. There had been that time when the three of them had been all that was left of a 100 strong group, and Mad Barlan  and his raiders were advancing on their little bolthole. Extended torture and slow death seemed certain.Dira had put her hand out and her husband gave it a gentle squeeze, and they had shared a look that had warmed her - despite her hunger and terror and tiredness. She wondered again if that kind of bond was a dwarf thing, because she certainly hadn't seen that in humans all her life.It would be nice to have something like that, she thought. But the world was what it was, and had to be taken the way it was. She smiled a little at her thoughts. She'd been hanging around with the dwarves for a long time, it seemed.  </p>
    <p>Dax was staring into the fire. The boy had been moody lately, saying very little, seemingly lost in his own thoughts all the time.Still trying to find his place in the world, the poor kid. He was good at a lot of things, but not good enough. Not ruthless enough to be a killer, not educated enough to be a scholar, but believing that if he tried hard enough, he could be something. But the old man had seen something in him, and the old man usually was good at these things. She wondered what it was. But he was better than the usual foot soldier, a little over eager, but then, he was young. He looked up and gave her a tentative smile, as though unsure of her response - as though he expected her to look through him, and wasn't sure what to do with the smile if ashe did. She took pity on him, and gave him a grin. He visibly relaxed. "So, what does the fire tell you, Daxan?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"What? Oh, the fire," he said sheepishly. Then he gave her his usual grin. "It was telling me about your brothel bills. Tell me, does the madame of the Butterfly Pea rub her hands together in glee when she sees you enter? Do they give you a freqent patron discount? How long did it take you to disentangle yourself from the heap of bodies you were under when I came to tell you you were wanted?'"
    <p>Sorcia rolled her eyes. "You would know if you were able to last more than a couple of minutes there. Serves me right for  trying to be nice!" She gave him a mock scowl, and he grinned.</p>
    <p>"We should be there by noon tomorrow," Keorn said. "Vivaan's already there. With Devi, Alvandor's representative. They traveled here together."</p>
