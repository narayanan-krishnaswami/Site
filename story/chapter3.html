<p>The invitation was from Alvandor.  Svaran had heard of him, of course. But that was because it was a part of Svaran's job to know things. Not many others would have known that Alvandor was one of the wealthiest men in the continent. He kept a low profile, was supposed to be a tough negotiator, but also scrupulously honest, and people who dealt with him generally spoke well of him.</p> 
<p>All this was well and good, but the invite was to a meeting at Nirupa's Tryst - and ordinary people did not meet there. Nirupa's Tryst was where the Celestials and Demons had signed their first accord - and they still remained bound by it. A deal at Nirupa's Tryst meant absolute good faith to solve a problem, to stay true to both letter and spirit of any agreement that was signed there. So why would a merchant - a wealthy and influential merchant, yes, but still a merchant, want to meet with a leader of a mercenary group there?  Given that Svaran had jealously guarded his reputation for integrity and discretion? Was what Alvandor going to propose going to be so outrageous that he wanted to ensure that Svaran stayed silent? </p>
<p>The normal procedure in these matters was that if a job wasn't taken up, a quick murder or two would follow to ensure silence. But murders could be botched, and Svaran knew that while he was older and not as dangerous as he used to be, he still wouldn't be easy prey. And his personal guard were some of his best people, and they weren't exactly pushovers either. And then there was Sorcia.</p> 
<p>He would go, he thought. It would be interesting. And Nirupa's Tryst guaranteed a certain level of safety- though who knew what loopholes existed.</p> 
<p>It was a month's  travel. The weather stayed fine, and they made good time.  It was early autumn and the trees were russet and gold. The great natural arch bridge where treaties were signed and pacts made soared gracefully across the river.</p>
<p>Alvandor's people had been there a while, it seemed. There was a small tent city up already, with two royal tents at the centre of the meadow.</p> 
<p>As Svaran and his retinue drew up, they were greeted by one of Alvandor's men. He was a plump, cheerful-looking man who led them to one of the royal tents.   "My name is Avil, Master Svaran the master has asked me to ensure that lack for nothing during your stay here," he said.</p> 
<p>Svaran looked around at the tent.  Even the most demanding sybarite couldn't have complained.  Silks and velvet everywhere. Even a meticulously sewn banner of the company. A separate enclosure with a marble bathtub. A marble bathtub! What kind of retinue did this merchant have?</p>  
<p>"We have arranged tents for your companions as well. We were not sure how large your retinue would be, and were afraid that we would have to suggest some sharing, but it looks like we estimated accurately."</p>
<p>"An estimate or accurate intelligence?" Svaran thought to himself. Either way, it was clear Alvandor didn't do things by halves. It would be an interesting meeting.</p>
<p>"I would love a hot bath, Master Avil," was all he said. "Can you have some one fill your lovely bathtub," he said.</p> 
<p>"It will be done." Avil bowed. "I also have a request from my master. He requests utter confidentiality on the discussions and his interests at your meeting, barring what disclosures the two of you agree on."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Svaran. Most of his clients  insisted on confidentiality, anyway. </p>

<p>There was nothing quite like a good bath after a long journey, thought Svaran. He had luxuriated in the tub until the scalding water turned cool, and now, smelling of tuberose petals and jasmine. It almost seemed a shame to wear his travelworn clothes again after that. </p>

<hr/>
<p>Alvandor was a big man, very tall and powerfully built. "I hope you found the arrangements comfortable," he said, in a basso rumble, as he led Svaran to the main canopy.</p> 
<p>Svaran studied him. Incredibly well groomed.   His robes were silk and velvet, deep purples, dark golds and rich scarlets. His skin was golden bronze, his eyes were amber, with dark pupils. There was something feline about him,  thought Svaran.</p>
<p>Tigerish.</p>
<p>The penny dropped.</p> 
<p>He knew why the meeting had to be here, at Nirupa's Tryst, and why the insistence on confidentiality</p>.
<p>Alvandor was smiling at him, the smile of a man who has seen a favoured but stupid pet perform a particularly clever trick.</p>
<p>"That saves tedious explanation," he smiled.</p>
<p>It was a terrifying smile.</p> 
<p>"Well, now. To business," said Alvandor.</p>
<p>Svaran nodded, trying to keep his face as expressionless as he could, and stilling his mind. A pointless exercise, of course. The rakshasa could read thoughts. But he would listen to what he had to say. This was business, after all.</p> 
<p>"Indeed. And very good business, if risky. But your company has a certain reputation when it comes to handling risk, which is why I have sought you out," said Alvandor.</p>
<p>"I have some interest in silver. One of them is a silver mine in the  Starfall Mountains. It's one of the richest -if not the richest - silver mines in the world, and I have a reasonably efficient mining and refining operation in Mooncrest. " He paused. "We began mining, oh, around twenty years ago.  Mooncrest was just a couple of huts at the edge of a cliff at the time. What the town is today is because of the mines. "</p>
<p>"Now the road from the mines to Mooncrest is around 17 miles long - winding through the mountainsides down to the valley.  There are dense pine forests on either side. There are a few hill giants, some large cats in the forests, but they have learnt to avoid the ore caravans.  We have been running these caravans since we started mining. "</p>
<p>"Four weeks ago, a caravan was attacked. It was the first attack in over two decades."</p> 
<p>Alvantor rapped the table with an exquisitely manicured fingernail.</p>
<p>"There were no survivors."</p>
<p>"Forty people. Thirty of them were  guards. And well trained - if I am any judge of these matters. Not the best soldiers, of course, but capable enough. Not one of the attackers were killed. No sign of who - or what attacked them."</p>
<p>"These caravans run every day. The next day, we doubled the guard on the caravans, and set riders, whose main job was to fly at the first sign of danger, and to let our people at Mooncrest know who these attackers were. "</p>
<p>"Nothing happened the next couple of weeks.  We didn't relax our guard though. Then...it happened again. No survivors."
"now, I could go there personally, and get to the bottom of this. But this is not, in the larger scheme of things, a significant enough event to warrant my personal attention. Which brings me to you."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Svaran nodded.</p> 
<p>Rakshasas seldom got their hands dirty, preferring agents and dupes - unwitting agents and dupes. And here was one who had straight up revealed himself, unprompted.  And if Svaran agreed to the job, he would be a witting agent - was witting even a word, he wondered.</p>
<p>"Yes, there's more here than meets your eye," smiled Alvandor. "But what I am ask is straightforward. I want you to stop these attacks on my mines. And if you succeed, you will be compensated well."</p>
<p>"So well that you can buy your own country if you want."</p>
