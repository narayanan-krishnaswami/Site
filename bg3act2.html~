  <p>Hey! It's me the checklist guy again and I'm back for Act
  2!&nbsp;<a href=
  "https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15o0ye9/spoilers_checklist_of_things_to_do_before_leaving/"
  target="_blank">Click here for the checklist for Act 1</a></p>
  <p>Here are things to do (+ bits that in my opinion are
  interesting) before leaving Act 2. The point of no return for Act
  2 is&nbsp;entering Shadowfell to retrieve the Nightsong then fightingKetheric.</p>
  <p>As the game did not clearly indicate to me where Act 2 begins,
  I will assume entering the Shadow Cursed Lands marks the start of
  Act 2. Again, this is a hero or a good guy playstyle, so your
  mileage may vary which also means this list is not
  exhaustive.</p>

      this, this house was marked on the map for me after reading a
