  <p>I've had an on-again/off-again blog for several years. Again, it was just supposed to be my little corner on the internet. It was a very basic site, but I did write stuff for it - nothing political, though I devoured the old politrical blogs. My memory isnt what it used to be, but I remember being a regular visitor to Daily Kos in the months following Bush vs Gore. There were so many great blogs, but then Facebook came along. Arthur Silber's Power of Narrative, Counterpunch, Mondoweiss, Firedoglake, TPM, TruthOut, Informed Comment - others whose websites I remember, but whose names slip my mind. Some of these are still around, but I get most of my content from Twitter these days - though that's likely to change once Musk starts charging. </p>
  <p>Anyway, here is some stuff from my old corner of the internet.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      My piece on George Orwell, Billy Bunter, the Loamshire Regiment and the schoolboy code is <a href="https://slackervision.blogspot.com/search/label/George%20Orwell">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>I love the Astaire Rogers musicals. He is, after all, up there with Garbo's salary, cellophane, Napoleon Brandy and Mahatma Gandhi. And<a href="https://slackervision.blogspot.com/2011/06/fred-astaire.html"> I waxed rhapsodic</a> about the binge I went on after Hari got me a Fred and Ginger double box set</>. 
  </ul>
