  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>This citadel of learning stands on a volcanic crag,
  overlooking the sea. It is a many-towered fortress, once the home
  of the famous seer Alaundo, and it preserves his predictions
  along with all the written records and learning of the Realms
  that can be assembled. Candlekeep is certainly no tourist resort,
  but there is a store, a temple and a fair inn here. The price for
  most travelers to enter the Keep proper is a book. Those wishing
  to examine any writing in the Keep's library must gift Candlekeep
    with a new tome of no less than 10,000 gp value.</p>

  <h3>Places of Note</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Candlekeep Inn<br />
    Ground Floor:<br />
    Firebead Elvenhair: Quest to retrieve an Identify scroll from
    Tethtoril (#14). You get 50 xp and a Potion of Healing, and
    Firebead casts Protection from Evil on you for doing so.<br />
    Inventory: Traveler's Robe, Dagger and 391 gp.<br />
    Worth: 2700 xp<br />
    Spoilers: Talk to Firebead 30 times and he gives you 300
    gp!<br />
    Strategy: If you wish to gain some easy experience so that you
    don't start the game as a level 1 character, you can use
    Firebead to do so. First, you will need some sort of missile
    weapon. A bow does the trick fine. Then, place yourself at the
    bottom of the stairs and start shooting at him. Each time he
    tries to cast a spell, go up the stairs and then come back to
    continue your attack. He uses Horror and Melf's Acid Arrow
    amongst other things, so it is important that you don't get
    hit. After a few tries, the old elf drops dead and you collect
    2700 xp and quite some gold! Then, export your character and
    start a new game. Your reputation will be restored and you'll
    keep your experience. Do this strategy 4 or 5 times and you'll
    reach level 5 quite easily!<br />
    Winthrop: Winthrop is the innkeeper of Candlekeep. He tries to
    be funny but he ends up being a bit pathetic. Anyway, be nice
    to him and he'll sell to you all you need to start your
    adventure.<br />
    Rooms: The 4 types of rooms are offered.<br />
    Shop: Basic weapons and armor.<br />
    Drinks: Yes.<br />
    Steal: Yes.<br />
    Chest: There is a chest in the room adjacent to that of
    Winthrop. It is easy to open and contains 18 gp and 2 scrolls:
    Armor and Infravision.<br />
    2nd Floor:<br />
    Noblemen: There are 2 pompous noblemen on this floor. Don't
    even bother to speak to them as they have nothing of value to
    say.<br />
    Chests: This level of the inn is perfect for a bit of thievery.
    The first 3 chests from the stairs are rather easy to open and
    they contain all together 40 gp, a Silver Necklace, and a
    Potion of Clarity. The chest in the room of one of the Noblemen
    can be opened but the guards will be summoned. It contains
    nevertheless 86 gp and a Flamedance Ring, so if you can escape
    the guard it is well worth it. Finally, the chest in the room
    opposite to that of the nobleman is very hard to open (it
    requires Open Locks 70) but contains a Star Sapphire (worth
    1000 gp!).<br /></li>
    <li>Phlydia<br />
    Quest to retrieve a book "The History of Halruaa" from a
    haystack (4). Gives you 50 xp and a Lynx Eye Gem (worth 7 gp)
    for doing so. Note that you can pickpocket Phlydia for a Gold
    Necklace (worth 30 gp).</li>
    <li>Priests' Quarters<br />
    Shank: An assassin (the first of many!) who wants to kill you
    in order to collect a bounty. He is easy to kill and is only
    worth 20 xp. Search the building afterwards for a bit of gold,
    a Dagger and a War Hammer.</li>
    <li>Dreppin<br />
    Quest to retrieve an Antidote for his sick cow, Nessa. He
    believes that the antidote is in Hull's possession (#8), but in
    fact it is at the barracks (#12) in Hull's chest (the one on
    the right portion of the room). Gives you 50 xp for doing
    so.</li>
    <li>Temple of Oghma<br />
    Priest of Oghma: Offers all the basic services of a temple:
    Healing, Donations, a Shop and an Identify section -- for a
    price, that is.</li>
    <li>Jondalar<br />
    Offers you a basic fighting lesson for free and even brings in
    an archer friend, Erik, during the fight. You take no damage
    and the fight stops when you hit either Jondalar or Erik. They
    then suggest that you see the Gatewarden (#10) if you wish to
    practice with a party.</li>
    <li>The Storehouse<br />
    Reevor: A retired army soldier who is guarding(?) the treasures
    of the Storehouse of the Keep. Sends you to kill the mice
    inside ASAP. There are 5 mice worth 1 xp each. Once your task
    is done, return to Reevor for 5 gp and 50 xp.</li>
    <li>Hull<br />
    Quest to bring his sword from the barracks (#12). He also tells
    you that Dreppin's Antidote is at the barracks too. Hull's bed
    and chest are the ones on the right portion of the room. You
    get 50 xp and 10 gp for helping Hull, or 20 gp if your charisma
    is 18 or more.</li>
    <li>Clinic<br />
    Priest of Oghma: Gives you a Potion of Healing if you ask. He
    has another on him for Pickpocketing. There is also a third
    potion in the drawer, but the guards are summoned no matter
    what (it usually works to Hide in Shadows and go to the door;
    even though you do not reach the "spot" because of the guard
    your PC still gets out).</li>
    <li>Gatewarden<br />
    Offers you the chance to train with a party of six created
    inside the storage cellars (just to the south) by Obe the
    Illusionist. Obe then summons illusionary monsters (who do you
    no damage) and lets you fight them. Each monster is worth 1 xp.
    However, one thing you may wish to try if you want to start the
    game with some good equipment is to go inside the storehouse
    and to put into your inventory all the good stuff the party
    has: Plate Mail, a Small Shield +1, a Potion of Healing, Oil of
    Speed, a Wand of the Heavens, and a Wand of Magic Missiles.
    Then export your character and start a new game. These items
    will still be there. Do not try to leave the storehouse because
    the items will then disappear.</li>
    <li>Bunkhouse<br />
    Carbos: Yet another assassin who tries to whack you. He is no
    harder than the first (#3) however, so you shouldn't have any
    trouble dispatching him. 20 xp for doing so.</li>
    <li>Barracks<br />
    Fuller: Quest to buy a set of 20 crossbow Bolts for him. He
    then gives you 50 xp and 10 gp for doing so. However, a
    charisma of 18 or more will earn you a Dagger +1. If you do not
    have a charisma of 18 but that you are a bard or a thief, try
    Pickpocketing Fuller for the dagger.<br />
    Hull's bed: On the right side of the room. You'll find Hull's
    Long Sword and Dreppin's Antidote. Do not try to open the other
    chests however, as the guards will be summoned.<br /></li>
    <li>Chanter and the Voices of the North, South, East and
    West<br />
    Not much of a show, but you can hear Alaundo's prophecy
    concerning the Lord of Murder, Bhaal.</li>
    <li>Tethtoril<br />
    You'll meet Tethtoril wandering around the courtyard to the
    keep. He'll have the Identify scroll Firebead needs, and he is
    also the most powerful character around. Do not try to attack
    him as he takes no damage and will finish you off with the good
    old Call Lightning spell.</li>
    <li>Imoen<br />
    NPC (NG, Human Female, Thief). The chat with Imoen reveals that
    you are good friends and that you see each other from time to
    time. She also lets you know that she knows that you are
    leaving on a trip with Gorion but refuses to tell you anything
    else. Imoen joins you a bit later in the game once you leave
    Candlekeep. She is a very good thief and can also be
    dual-classed into a mage.</li>
    <li>Gorien<br />
    Urges you to leave the keep as quickly as possible with him.
    Before doing so he heals you and also tells you that should
    something happen to him, you should not hesitate and seek the
    help and counsel of Khalid and Jaheira, both present at the
    Friendly Arm Inn (how clairvoyant of him). Before agreeing to
    leave, be sure to complete all of the quests in the keep, and
    also go shopping so you have some basic supplies for your
    character. You might also want to buy Arrows and Leather Armor
    since Imoen will be joining you shortly.<br />
    Note: You won't be allowed to enter the keep behind Gorion
    until Chapter 6.</li>
    <li>The Keeper of the Portal<br />
    Asks you for a book of great value (10,000 gp) before he'll let
    you enter, despite knowing you! You won't have the book before
    Chapter 6, so don't bother returning to Candlekeep before
    then.</li>
