  <h1>Baldur's Gate 3 - Act 1</h1>
  <h3>Prologue: The Nautiloid</h3>
<p>After the opening cutscene, you wake up bloodstained and filthy. The nautiloid is burning, and there's a tadpole pool in front of you. You can interact with it, but all it does is knock you over. There are a few points of interest in this area - a mindflayer corpse, usually with a gem as loot; a cartilaginous chest with some random loot in a raised area behind the corpse; an onyx and another cartilaginous chest on the upper level right behind the point where you wake up. Pick these up and make your way to the next circular chamber by going through the sphincter. Yeah.</p>

<h3>
  The Temple of Lathander and Creche Y'llek</h3>
  <p>Once you have completed the bulk of Act 1, you take the mountain pass and you come to the Trielta Crags. The Trielta Crags waypoint is North NorthWest of the entry point, and you cant miss it if you follow the road.The roa forks at the waypoint. If you take the east fork and circle back south, you meet the trader Lady Esther. The Lady Esther give you the Githyank Egg quest, and also stocks healing potions. Her best item is the Graceful Cloth, a +2 Dexterity Robe which also increases your jump distance - ideal for barbarians, and maybe sorcerers. I used it on Karlach along with the Bracers of Defence - and that took her armor class to 17.</p>
  <p>Further north, the road is mined with repulsor mines which knock you back but don't do much damage. At the end of the road are undead - two Death Shepherds in heavy armor, 4 ghouls and a ghast. The ghould have a stinking cloud aura that makes you nauseous. Nausea makes you unable to take actions, so it is a bit of a pain for your melee warriors. Also, the Death Shepherds have the annoying tendency of reviving killed undeads, inclding themselves, so killing them early, and in the same turn is advisable.</p>

  <h3>Creche Y'llek</h3>
  <p>It's ideal to have L'zarl with you when you go to the creche, it's part of her quest, and there are many additional dialog options  when you have her in your poarty. You can also increase your approval levels with her to absurd levels here, no matter what you choose.</p>
  <p>WThe first person n the crechehen you fuirst enter the creche, you will be met by a group of Githyanki, and you will be ordered to go to the infirmary for the extraction. The person you will haveto meet is <i>Ghustil</i> Stornugoss, a slightly crazy Githyanki medic. Stornugoss asks you to step unto the <i>zaith'isk</i>, a Githyanki tadpole extraction machine. The machine is on a podium and you can pass an intelligence (DC 15) check to understand its both organic and inorganic. If you get into the machine you have to pass a series of saving throws (Intelligence DC 15, Wisdom 15,  Constitution 18 or Intelligence 18). If you pass these tests, you get the Awakened buff which allows to use your illithid powers as a bonus action.</p>
