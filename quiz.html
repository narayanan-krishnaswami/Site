    <li>In 2003, when the French declined to support the US
    invasion of Iraq, the then Republican Chairman of the Committee
    on House Administration, Bob Ney, had the French Fries in the
    Congressional canteens renamed to "Freedom Fries". But this
    wasn't the first time a food item had been renamed because of
    hostile relations with another country. In World War I, the
    British renamed a certain edible item "Liberty Cabbage". What
    was it?</li>
    <li>In 1874, Dr Robert Kedzie, a surgeon during the US Civil
    War, wrote a book called "Shadows from the Walls of Death". The
    book was considered so dangerous that of the 100 copies first
    published, only 4 remain. The others were all destroyed. Why
    was this book considered so dangerous?</li>
    <li>In 2004, online insurance seller Esurance launched a series
    of advertisements featuring a animated secret agent called Erin
    Esurance, modeled on Jennifer Garner's character Sydney Bristow
    from the TV series alias, as their mascot. But they retired
    her, abruptly in 2010. Why?<br />

    <li>Jeffrey Allen Baxter's career as a defense consultant began
    when he, as a self taught missile scientist, presented a paper
    to US Congressman Dana Rohrbacher on converting a ship based
    anti-aircraft system into a missile defense system. He later
    would go on to become a consultant to the Pentagon and the US
    Department of Defense, as well as a member of the NASA
    Exploration Systems Advisory Committee. But his first career
    was something else entirely, and quite successful. What was
    it?</li>
    <li>Which English king had bloated so much at the time of his
    burial that he could not fit into the hole dug for him, and
    when the gravediggers tried to force his corpse in, it
    exploded, covering mourners with his putrifying innards?</li>
    <li>The Sacred Band of Thebes was a group of 300 fierce
    soldiers, and the elite unit of the Theban army in 4 BC. They
    were responsible for the defeat of the Spartan army in the
    Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. What was special about them?</li>
    <li>Identify the painter of this 1876 watercolour of the Ganges

    <li>On June 30, 1898, Willy Wilcke and Max Christian Priester
    climbed on to the window sill of this man’s residence and took
    this photo. The house owner had been dead for a few hours, and
    the two changed the time on the bedside clock to show that the
    photo had been taken at the time of death. When they attempted
    to sell this photo, they were arrested, and the picture was
    finally released to the public only in 1952. Who was the
    statesman who was the subject of the photo.<br/><img alt=

    <li>This festival has been called Beltane, or alternatively,
    Bealtaine, Bealltainn or Boaldyn. It celebrates summer, and
    traditionally, two huge bonfires are lit in fields. Cattle are
    driven through these bonfires to protect them from disease. The
    dew gathered on the morning of Beltane is supposed to have
    magical powers, and increase sexual attractiveness. Beltane
    falls on another, more secular, holiday. When is Beltane
    celebrated.</li>

    <li>In late 1858 - or early 1859, Alexander Rhind, a Scotsman
    living in Egypt, purchased a manuscript, a papyrus 18 feet long
    and 13 inches wide. The papyrus, titled “Accurate Rendering,
    The Entrance into the Knowledge of All Existing Things and All
    Obscure Secrets” , was believed to date back to 1650 BC. It was
    a copy of another work, which was written 200 years earlier.
    The Rhind manuscript, as it was called, was the earliest
    discovered object of its kind. What was it?<br />

    <li>In 1948, the British engineer Tom Kilburn led the work on
    designing and building a Small Scale Experimental Machine, "The
    Baby". This tested in practice the ability of the
    Williams-Kilburn Tube to read and reset at speed random bits of
    information, while preserving a bit's value indefinitely
    between resettings. And for the first time in the world a
    computer was built that could hold any (small!) user program in
    electronic storage and process it at electronic speeds. He
    wrote the first program for it, which first worked on June 21st
    1948. What did the program do?<br />
